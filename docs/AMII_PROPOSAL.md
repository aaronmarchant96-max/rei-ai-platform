# REI: An AI That Respects Your Budget as Much as Your Time

**AMII Grant Proposal**  
**Project:** REI — Transparent Token-Efficient Reasoning Engine  
**Duration:** 6 months · **Request:** $5,000 CAD

---

## Executive Summary

REI is an AI that respects your budget as much as your time. It makes reasoning auditable by exposing the hinge point, evidence tiers, and what-would-change-the-conclusion in every response. A cost-aware routing layer (Night Shift) selects the cheapest model that meets a confidence threshold, reducing inference costs 68% below always-premium baselines. All routing decisions are deterministic and testable — zero inference dependency in the router itself.

The system has processed 601 million tokens across 1,497 API calls at a total cost of $9.03, demonstrating production-scale efficiency. A 57-prompt benchmark suite across 9 categories confirms 80% routing accuracy with 162 passing tests and zero inference cost in the evaluation harness.

## AMII Research Theme Alignment

REI directly addresses five of AMII's core research themes:

### 1. Responsible AI
Every routing decision in REI is traceable, confidence-scored, and auditable. The Night Shift router produces a complete decision trace: which fingerprint matched, at what confidence, what alternatives were considered, and what the cost delta was versus the most expensive option. No black-box model selection.

**Evidence:** `src/lib/nightShiftRouter.js` — `buildRouterDecision()` produces explicit `routingConfidence`, `rationale`, `alternativeRoutes` with `costDeltaFromSelected` and `savingsPercentage` for every decision.

### 2. Interpretability
CARDO REI makes the reasoning structure explicit: the hinge point (falsifiable claim), facts versus assumptions, evaluation strength, what would change the conclusion, and the smallest useful next move. This is not post-hoc explanation — it's the native output format.

**Evidence:** `api/cfai.js` — hardened assistant domain prompt enforces hinge-as-falsifiable-claim with contrapositive ("what would change my mind"). `src/lib/replyParser.js` — deterministic parser extracts structured reasoning sections from responses.

### 3. Efficient ML
Night Shift router reduces inference cost 68% compared to always-premium routing. Layer 0 deterministic engine handles ~15-20% of queries at $0 cost. The 5-message sliding window keeps context payloads minimal. Fingerprint catalog matching costs <1ms per decision with zero inference.

**Evidence:** 57-prompt benchmark: `$0.280 saved vs $0.410 always-premium`. Production data: 441M tokens, $3.83 total cost across 1,194 API calls.

### 4. Reproducible AI
Identical input → identical routing decision. The fingerprint catalog is deterministic — no model inference, no embeddings, no non-deterministic hashing. Confidence thresholds are versioned in `data/fingerprints.json`. The `routingConfidence` fallback chain (catalog score → fingerprint threshold → default 0.5) is explicit and auditable.

**Evidence:** `src/__eval__/routingEval.test.js` — 57 test cases produce identical results every run. The benchmark harness has zero inference cost.

### 5. Applied AI for Alberta
The genealogy domain applies structured reasoning to historical record evaluation — military pay vouchers, parish registers, census records, family correspondence. Evidence tiering (🟢 Primary / 🔵 Strong / 🟠 Needs Review / 🟡 Family Memory) generalizes to any domain where source reliability varies. The Marchant Family Archive integration demonstrates real-world application.

**Evidence:** `api/cfai.js` — genealogy domain prompt with canonical profiles. `src/components/EvidenceCard.jsx` — tier-based evidence rendering. `src/__eval__/evidenceEval.test.js` — 10 deterministic parser tests.

## Technical Architecture

```
Query → Layer 0: Deterministic Engine ($0, instant)
      → Layer 1: Night Shift Router (fingerprint catalog + confidence)
      → Layer 2: Domain Detection (coding, genealogy, story — isolated from history)
      → Layer 3: CARDO GUARD (cost-governor — escalation decision)
      → Response + structured reasoning trace
```

## Budget

| Line item | CAD |
|-----------|-----|
| API compute (3 months, estimated; see peak-pricing note below) | $1,500 |
| Hosting + deployment (Vercel, Docker) | $600 |
| Developer stipend (documentation, testing, release) | $2,000 |
| Dissemination (open-source release, grant writeup) | $900 |
| **Total requested** | **$5,000** |

> **Peak-pricing note (July 2026):** DeepSeek adopted peak-valley pricing mid-July 2026 — 2× base rate during UTC 1:00–4:00 AM and 6:00–10:00 AM. The API compute line accounts for this by budgeting at an effective blended rate. Prior efficiency (601M tokens / $9.03 = $0.0108/M) was achieved before peak pricing took effect; forward-looking estimates apply a 1.3× multiplier to the historical rate.
