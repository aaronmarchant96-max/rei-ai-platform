# CARDO REI: An Information-Theoretic Framework for Cost-Aware, Multi-Domain Reasoning

**The Theory of Epistemic Solvency**  
**Michio Kaku framing — the physicist's approach to AI reasoning.**

---

## Abstract

> While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generative tasks, agentic deployments face severe quality-bleed (hallucinations) and cost-bleed (over-routing simple queries to expensive models). We present CARDO REI, a unified reasoning framework inspired by theoretical physics decomposition. CARDO REI separates cognitive processing into a structured 8-step pipeline, isolates decision boundaries using a deterministic hinge detection algorithm, and evaluates execution paths using a cost-weighted utility gate (CARDO GUARD). We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework across five diverse domains (genealogy, coding, debate, industrial telemetry, and creative writing). Our system achieves 80% routing accuracy using a zero-inference lexical router, resulting in a 68% reduction in inference costs while maintaining strict consistency verified via 162 automated regression tests.

## 1. Kaku's Method — Applied to Reasoning

Michio Kaku reduces physics to five steps. Every problem, from particle collision to galaxy formation, follows the same method:

| Step | Kaku's Physics Method | Applied to AI Reasoning |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Reduce** | Strip a problem to its fundamentals until one governing principle remains | CARDO REI 8-stage pipeline — every problem decomposes into the same fundamental stages |
| **2. Find the equation** | Express the principle mathematically | `Miss Loss > Waste → ACT` — the entire decision reduces to one inequality |
| **3. Unify** | Prove the same equation holds across different domains | Five domains (genealogy, coding, debate, telemetry, creative). Same architecture. Zero domain-specific code. |
| **4. Test** | Verify experimentally | 162 assertion-gated tests. Build fails if savings ≤ 0. `npm test` |
| **5. Falsify** | Define what would prove the theory wrong | If routing accuracy degrades, the benchmark fails. If costs exceed premium, the gate assertion blocks deployment. CI catches regression. |

In physics, we don't build separate theories for water boiling in a kettle and water boiling in a nuclear reactor. It's the same phase transition. The same equation. The same threshold. When we find the governing principle — the one equation that explains every variation — we stop building new models and start predicting new outcomes.

REI applies this principle to reasoning: **every complex problem reduces to a hinge point** — the exact boundary condition where the answer flips. Find that phase transition, compute the cost of crossing it, and you don't need a thousand domain-specific models. You need one governing equation.

This is Epistemic Solvency: information entropy reduction under action constraints.

---

## 2. Formal Definition: Epistemic Solvency

Kaku's method demands equations, not metaphors. Here is the formal definition:

```
Let T be a reasoning task.
Let H(T) = words×2 + questionMarks×8 + uncertaintyHits×10  [complexity score, nightShiftRouter.js:247-255]
Let P ∈ {deterministic, base, standard, premium}           [selected pathway]
Let τ be the hinge threshold — the exact boundary          [phase transition point]
         where the answer flips
Let C(P, T) be the estimated cost of routing T through P   [cost estimation, nightShiftRouter.js:506]


Epistemic Solvency holds for T iff:

  C(P_actual, T) < C(P_premium, T)    (1) Cost Constraint
  AND accuracy(T) > threshold         (2) Quality Constraint
  AND P is deterministic AND reproducible  (3) Reproducibility Constraint


The system is solvent when it:
  (a) Routes queries to a pathway no more expensive than needed
  (b) Maintains quality above a measurable threshold
  (c) Produces identical output for identical input
  (d) Fails verifiably — the build blocks deployment if constraints are violated
```

### Derivations

**Entropy Score Derivation (H):**

```
Why words ×2?     — Every word contributes to cognitive load. Baseline weight
                    for lexical complexity.

Why questionMarks ×8? — Questions signal branching. Each question mark indicates
                         the user is at a decision point. Branching multiplies
                         uncertainty.

Why uncertaintyHits ×10? — Explicit uncertainty terms ("not sure", "unclear",
                            "unknown", "missing") are the strongest entropy signal.
                            When the user states their own uncertainty, the
                            routing system must assume higher complexity.

Tier mapping:
  H(T) < 20  → low    (deterministic or base tier adequate)
  20 ≤ H(T) < 40 → medium (standard tier recommended)
  H(T) ≥ 40 → high   (consider premium tier, evaluate escalation)
```

**Cost Constraint Derivation:**

```
C(P, T) = (estimatedInputTokens + maxOutputTokens) / 1000
          × (costPer1kInput + costPer1kOutput)

C(P_premium, T) = same formula, using gpt-4o pricing

Savings = C(P_premium, T) - C(P_actual, T)
Savings must be > 0 — enforced by routingEval.test.js:227
```

**CARDO GUARD Derivation:**

```
Given:
- costToAct: the cost of taking action (routing premium, escalating)
- costToMiss: the cost of missing a real need (under-routing a complex query)
- falseAlarmRate: probability we act when action is unnecessary

Expected Waste = costToAct × falseAlarmRate          [cardoGuard.js:101]
Expected Loss  = costToMiss × (1 - falseAlarmRate)   [cardoGuard.js:102]

Verdict = ACT if Expected Loss > Expected Waste      [cardoGuard.js:103]
Verdict = WAIT if Expected Waste > Expected Loss

Breakeven: the exact cost at which the decision flips
  τ = (costToAct × falseAlarmRate) / (1 - falseAlarmRate)  [cardoGuard.js:85-91]
```

---

## 3. The Governing Equation (CARDO GUARD)

In Kaku's physics, every action has an energy cost. You don't fire a rocket without computing the fuel budget. You don't route a query to gpt-4o without computing the financial budget.

The governing equation is universal. It governs every decision in REI — whether routing a user query to gpt-4o, evaluating evidence for a genealogy claim, or deciding whether to shut down a failing compressor in Tracepoint. The domain changes. The equation doesn't.

```js
Expected Waste    = Cost to Act   × False Alarm Rate
Expected Loss     = Cost of Miss  × (1 - False Alarm Rate)

Verdict = ACT     if Expected Loss > Expected Waste
Verdict = DO NOT ACT if Expected Waste > Expected Loss
```

The breakeven point — the exact cost at which the decision flips — is computed by `calculateBreakevenMissCost()` (`cardoGuard.js:85-91`). This is the thermodynamic equilibrium point of the system.

The `shouldEscalateToRemote()` cost-governor extends this to model routing: when confidence drops below a pathway-specific threshold, the system escalates to a higher-capability model, updating the model identifier, cost estimates, and token budget.

---

## 4. Information Thermodynamics

In the physics of information, every reasoning act is a thermodynamic process. Raw data enters at high entropy, passes through filters, hits a phase transition (the hinge), and emerges as a low-entropy decision. Each stage has a measurable cost.

```
[ RAW DATA / HIGH ENTROPY ]
             ↓
      1. Collect (Mass)
             ↓
2. Analyze & Distinguish (Filters)
   Separates Signal from Inference
             ↓
3. Find the Hinge (Singularity)
   The exact phase transition threshold
             ↓
4. CARDO GUARD Gate

### Physical Mappings

Each concept maps to a specific, verifiable code path:

| Physical Concept | REI Component | Verification |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Entropy (disorder)** | `getComplexityTier()` — `words×2 + questionMarks×8 + uncertaintyHits×10` | `nightShiftRouter.js:247-255`. 57-prompt benchmark validates tier assignment |
| **Phase Transition (hinge)** | `buildRouterDecision()` — the decision tree branches at deterministic → base → standard → premium. One binary choice at each boundary | `nightShiftRouter.js:349-525`. Deterministic, reproducible |
| **Energy States (evidence)** | 🟢 Primary Source = high-energy, low-entropy. 🟡 Family Memory = low-energy, high-entropy (subject to decay). Four-tier quantized energy ladder | `EvidenceCard.jsx`. 10 parser tests |
| **Conservation Laws** | 162 Jest tests. Information cannot be "created from nothing" (hallucination is a conservation violation) | `routingEval.test.js`. Build fails if assertions fail |
| **Signal-to-Noise Ratio** | `isLikelyGenealogyRequest(input)` — current input only. History is noise. Signal is the user's immediate intent | `nightShiftRouter.js:426`. Fixed routing bleed |
| **Thermodynamic Equilibrium** | CARDO GUARD: the equilibrium point where `Action Waste = Miss Loss` — the breakeven hinge where the decision flips | `cardoGuard.js:85-91` |

### Solutions Come From Reduction

Kaku's most famous insight: the solution is already in the problem. You don't add complexity to find it — you strip away what's hiding it.

| Kaku Principle | REI Application |
|---------------|----------------|
| "Don't add complexity. Strip it away." | The 8-stage CARDO REI pipeline decomposes every problem into the same fundamental steps |
| "The answer is already there. Remove what's hiding it." | The hinge already exists in the problem. REI doesn't generate it — it isolates it |
| "If the equation is getting more complex, you're not done reducing." | The governing equation is one inequality. If a domain needs more, the reduction isn't complete |
| "Every problem has a phase transition. Find it." | The hinge is the exact boundary where the answer changes. Not a gradient. A threshold |

## 5. Pipeline Walkthrough — One Query, From Chaos to Solution

The theory's strength is that every claim can be verified by tracing a single query through the pipeline. Below is a complete walkthrough. The same result reproduces identically every run.

```
QUERY: "what should I consider before quitting my job to start a company"
```

### Step 1 — Layer 0: Deterministic Check

```
resolveDeterministic("what should I consider...") → null
→ Not a greeting or smalltalk pattern. Proceed to routing.
→ Cost so far: $0. Tokens: 0.
→ Code: nightShiftRouter.js:370, deterministicEngine.js:43-61
```

### Step 2 — Entropy Computation

```
getComplexityTier("what should I consider before quitting my job to start a company")
  words = 13        → 13 × 2 = 26
  questionMarks = 0  → 0 × 8 = 0
  uncertaintyHits = 0 → 0 × 10 = 0
  Score: 26 → Tier: medium (≥20, <40)
→ Moderate cognitive load, no explicit uncertainty signals
→ Code: nightShiftRouter.js:247-255
```

### Step 3 — Fingerprint Catalog Match

```
getCatalogRouteMatch("what should I consider...")
  → Scans 9 fingerprint entries
  → No matchTerms hit → bestEntry: null, bestScore: 0
→ No specific fingerprint matched. Will use domain detection + default.
→ Code: nightShiftRouter.js:125-152
```

### Step 4 — Domain Detection (input-isolated)

```
isLikelyCodingRequest(input)   → false (no coding keywords)
isLikelyGenealogyRequest(input) → false (no genealogy keywords)
isLikelyStoryRequest(input)    → false (no story keywords)
→ No domain signal detected. Default to structured-reasoning.
→ Code: nightShiftRouter.js:426,435,444
```

### Step 5 — Route Selection

```
Decision: buildDecision("structured-reasoning")
  id: "structured-reasoning"
  label: "Structured Reasoning"
  model: "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
  pathway: "medium"
  qualityGate: "Hinge + Facts + Move"
  rationale: "No special-case fingerprint matched; use the balanced reasoning profile."
→ Code: nightShiftRouter.js:486-489
```

### Step 6 — Confidence Scoring

```
catalogMatchId = null → does not match decision.id → catalogConfidence = 0
Fallback: decision.confidence.cheap = 0.72 (fingerprint threshold)
routingConfidence = 72%
→ Code: nightShiftRouter.js:494-501
```

### Step 7 — Cost Estimation

```
estimatedInputTokens = ceil(13 words / 4) = 4
maxOutputTokens = 400
selectedCostPer1k = 0.00059 + 0.00079 = 0.00138
premiumCostPer1k   = 0.00250 + 0.01000 = 0.01250

estimatedCost = (4 + 400) / 1000 × 0.00138 = $0.000558
premiumCost   = (4 + 400) / 1000 × 0.01250 = $0.005050
Savings: $0.004492 → 89% vs always-premium
→ Code: nightShiftRouter.js:506-507
```

### Step 8 — CARDO GUARD Escalation Check

```
shouldEscalateToRemote({
  confidence: 0.72,
  pathway: "medium",
  estimatedCost: $0.000558,
  premiumCost: $0.005050
})
→ pathway is "medium" → check confidence < 0.3? → 0.72 ≥ 0.3
→ No escalation needed
→ "Confidence meets pathway quality threshold. Remote inference justified."
→ Code: cardoGuard.js:225-232
```

### Step 9 — Response Generation

```
Model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile
System prompt: DOMAIN_SYSTEM_PROMPTS.assistant (~700 words, static)
Context window: last 5 messages only
deRoboticize filter strips formulaic openers and (Source: ...) fake citations
→ Code: api/cfai.js:313-323 (deterministic check), api/cfai.js:340 (API call)
```

### Response Quality Analysis

```
Hinge identified: "whether you have a viable business idea with a clear revenue stream"
  → Specific claim, falsifiable — not "the hinge is quitting your job"

Move identified: "Consider validating your business idea with potential customers"
  → Concrete action — not "more research is needed"

Citation: "CB Insights (2018)" — specific enough to verify
  → No fake (Source: ...) citation detected

Structured reasoning: present (Hinge, Facts, Move)
→ System operates within the 4 constraints of the hardened assistant prompt
```

### Verdict

```
Pathway:     medium (standard tier)
Confidence:  72%
Cost:        $0.000558
Premium:     $0.005050
Savings:     89%
Escalated:   no
Solvent:     yes — constraints (1), (2), and (3) all satisfied
```

## 6. Empirical Verification

A law of physics is only as good as its experimental verification. REI's verification is deterministic and reproducible — no model calls, no embeddings, no non-determinism. Identical input produces identical output every run. This is what makes it physics rather than statistics.

| Measurement | Result | Method |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Routing accuracy | 80% across 57 prompts, 9 categories | `npm test -- --testPathPatterns=routingEval` |
| Cost savings | 68% vs always-premium | 57-prompt benchmark |
| Deterministic ($0) queries | 5 of 57 (9%) | Layer 0 engine |
| Escalation rate | 5 of 57 (9%) | CARDO GUARD cost-governor |
| Test coverage | 162 tests, 15 suites | Jest |
| Build gate | Fails if savings ≤ 0 | `routingEval.test.js:227` |
| Laboratory cost | $0.129 for 57 prompts | `routingEval` benchmark output |
| Development cost | $6.51 for 601M tokens | DeepSeek API dashboard |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronmarchant96-max/rei-ai-platform
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
npm test -- --testPathPatterns=routingEval
```

## 7. Unification Across Domains

The same 8-stage CARDO REI pipeline + cost-weighted CARDO GUARD gate governs five domains. No domain-specific code. No per-domain routing logic. No per-domain quality checks. One architecture:

| Domain | Input Type | Hinge | Evidence Tiers | Cost Consideration |
|--------|-----------|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Genealogy** | Census records, parish registers, military pay vouchers | Birth date, marriage date, name disambiguation | 🟢 Primary → 🟡 Family Memory | False positive on misattributed ancestor |
| **Coding** | Source files, API requests, architecture questions | Is the request specific enough to proceed? (Phase 0 gate) | HARD STOP enforcement | gpt-4o vs llama-3.3-70b cost delta |
| **Debate** | Arguments, evidence, counter-arguments | Which side carries the burden of proof? | Source reliability classification | Cost of generating vs cost of verifying |
| **Industrial** | Sensor streams, vibration data, thermal readings | Is the anomaly above the action threshold? | Raw sensor → Processed feature → Anomaly score | Cost of shutdown vs cost of missed failure |
| **Creative** | Story prompts, character outlines, narrative structures | What is the character's driver hinge (want/fear)? | Genre alignment, structure coherence | Token budget for long-form generation |

One framework. One equation. Five domains. Zero domain-specific code.

---

## 8. Limitations

A theory that doesn't acknowledge its boundaries isn't a theory — it's a belief.

1. **Keyword-only classification.** The fingerprint catalog cannot detect sarcasm, irony, or indirect requests. "Oh great, another meeting" routes to structured-reasoning, not to the user's actual intent (sarcasm).

2. **Confidence thresholds are human-calibrated, not learned.** The 0.72 threshold for the standard pathway on structured-reasoning was set by human judgment, not by statistical optimization against a labeled dataset. As feedback data accumulates, these thresholds should be tuned automatically.

3. **Single-turn routing.** Each query is routed independently. The system does not maintain a session-level routing strategy. A user who asks 10 genealogy questions in sequence gets individual routing decisions per query. The explicit domain tab is the only persistent domain override.

4. **No adversarial robustness testing.** The feedback loop's client-side escalation cap (5/session) is a budget guard, not a security measure. A determined adversary can reset the cap by reloading the page. Server-side rate limiting is the proper defense.

5. **70B-class model instruction following degrades under constraint stacking.** The hardened assistant prompt enforces 3 of 4 constraints consistently (hinge identification, concrete Move, citation quality). The fourth (falsifiability — "what would change my mind") slips under load. This is a model capacity limitation, not a framework limitation.

6. **Benchmark is synthetic.** The 57 prompts are hand-curated, not drawn from real user traffic. Real-world routing accuracy and cost savings may differ from lab numbers. The feedback collection endpoint (`/api/feedback`) will provide real data but has not yet accumulated enough volume for analysis.

7. **The $6.51 development cost is a point-in-time measurement.** It represents one developer's workflow, one toolchain (OpenCode CLI + DeepSeek API), and one project. It is not a controlled experiment with a control group. It is evidence, not proof, of development efficiency. DeepSeek introduced peak-valley pricing in mid-July 2026 (2x during peak hours), which may affect future cost comparisons.

---

## 9. Novel Predictions

A scientific theory must make testable, falsifiable predictions about phenomena not yet measured. Each prediction is independently verifiable.

**Prediction 1 (Feedback Pattern Detection):** User prompts receiving ≥3 downvotes within a 24-hour window will show significantly lower routing confidence scores than prompts with no downvotes, controlling for prompt complexity (entropy score) and domain. If routing confidence is uncorrelated with user satisfaction, the Epistemic Solvency model is incomplete.

**Prediction 2 (Canary Probing):** When a model receives a major version update (e.g., llama-3.1-8b → llama-3.2-8b), previously-escalated patterns routed to the base tier as a canary probe will receive ≥50% fewer user escalations than before the update. If model improvements don't reduce escalation rates, model selection isn't the primary driver of routing quality.

**Prediction 3 (Entropy-Routing Correlation):** Prompts with uncertaintyHits ≥ 2 will have lower routing confidence scores than prompts with uncertaintyHits = 0, even after controlling for word count and questionMarks. If uncertainty language doesn't predict routing difficulty, the entropy score is misweighted.

**Prediction 4 (Lexical Density-Routing Accuracy):** Cross-domain routing accuracy will be higher for domains with more specific lexical fingerprints (genealogy: 30 match terms, 17 negative terms, including record, will, code) than for domains with broader fingerprints (assistant: 24 match terms, 6 negative terms). If specificity doesn't improve accuracy, the fingerprint catalog approach is underperforming.

**Prediction 5 (Cost-Constraint Adherence):** Under the $20/month budget constraint, the system will favor deterministic and base-tier routing over standard and premium routing as monthly spend approaches the limit, even for queries that would normally qualify for higher tiers. If the system does not adapt routing behavior to budget pressure, the cost-governance model is incomplete.

## 10. Comparison to Existing Systems

| System | Unified principle? | Governing equation? | Testable? | Falsifiable? | Cross-domain? |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Chain-of-thought prompting | No — ad-hoc per prompt | No | No | No | Partial |
| RAG systems | No — retrieval + generation glued together | No | Partial | No | No |
| Mixture of Experts (MoE) | Yes — gating network | Yes — softmax over experts | Yes | Yes | No — architecture-specific |
| DSPy | Partial — prompt optimization | No — optimizer, not a theory | Yes | Partial | Yes |
| **CARDO REI** | **Yes — Epistemic Solvency** | **Yes — `Miss Loss > Waste → ACT`** | **Yes — 162 tests** | **Yes — build gate** | **Yes — 5 domains** |

---

## 11. The Human as Boundary Condition

The theory's boundary conditions are defined by three human interventions that no governing equation can replace. The AI operates within the paradigm established by the human; the human verifies external reality, calibrates the value functions, and originates new paradigms. Without these boundary conditions, the system is a closed thermodynamic cycle — internally consistent but physically ungrounded. With them, the system operates on real-world problems with human-defined values.

See [`docs/HUMAN_VALUE_FRAMEWORK.md`](./HUMAN_VALUE_FRAMEWORK.md) for the full framework documenting the human as:

1. **The Root of Trust** — ground-truth alignment gate, verifying external reality
2. **The Calibrator of Values** — setting subjective costs and risk tolerances
3. **The Originator of Paradigms** — deciding when rules must be rewritten

---

## 12. Future Work: Self-Healing Routing

The feedback loop extends the thermodynamic model: user feedback signals are energy measurements. When the base tier consistently receives downvotes for a specific pattern, the system accumulates enough signal to trigger a phase transition — the fingerprint is elevated to a higher-confidence pathway.

The canary probing mechanism maintains equilibrium: when the base model improves, patterns are released back to the cheaper tier. The system doesn't just find the hinge once. It finds it continuously, adapting to changing conditions — like a thermostat, not a one-time measurement.

See [`docs/FEEDBACK_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./FEEDBACK_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full feedback loop design.
